/**
 * Unlike the import-time rule pass — which deliberately touches only uncategorized rows — this
 * reports on *every* match, including rows that already carry a different category. Filing the
 * stragglers consistently is the whole point of creating a rule from a transaction you are looking
 * at, and the caller is expected to show `moving` in full before writing anything.
 *
 * One class of row is held back regardless: a match the rule would flip from a money movement into
 * spending. A ledger of Apple purchases also contains "Apple Pay top-up by *1234" — money arriving
 * via a payment method that happens to share the merchant's name — and a pattern of "Apple" sweeps up
 * all 54 of them alongside the 204 real purchases. They are not mis-filed Apple charges to be
 * corrected; they are a different kind of row entirely.
 *
 * The test is deliberately "would this change flip it", not "is it a transfer": each match is
 * classified as it stands and again as it would stand under the new category, and it is protected
 * only when the first is economically neutral and the second is not. So a rule that files things
 * *into* Transfers or Savings moves them freely — nothing is being reclassified — and the rule needs
 * no list of category names of its own, deferring instead to the one classifier the whole plugin
 * shares. `includeNeutral` exists because it is a default, not a veto.
 *
 * An empty pattern or a missing target matches nothing rather than everything: `"".includes()` is
 * true for every string, so the guard is load-bearing, not defensive decoration.

/**

 * numeric token: "ALBERT HEIJN". Everything after it is branch, city, date or reference.

 * Deliberately *not* `merchantKey`, despite that being the plugin's own idea of a merchant's
 * identity. That key exists for grouping, where both sides are normalised before they meet, so it is
 * free to rewrite the text — it lowercases, folds punctuation to spaces and drops short tokens. A
 * non-regex rule is a raw substring test against the original description, and a rewritten key is not
 * generally a substring of what it came from: "ONLY&SONS" keys to "only sons", which never appears in
 * "only&sons", and "H&M 0123 AMSTERDAM" keys to "amsterdam", which would file every Amsterdam
 * transaction in the ledger under H&M. Cutting a prefix on whitespace can do neither, because the
 * result is a substring of the original by construction.
 *
 * The trailing trim keeps a dangling separator out of the pattern ("TICKETS - 4412" → "TICKETS", not
 * "TICKETS -"), and a description that opens with a number is kept whole rather than reduced to "".
