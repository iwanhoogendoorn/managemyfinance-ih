/**
 * Ad-hoc reporting: "what did I spend on restaurants in 2025", "what has the car cost me", "both of
 * those together, per month".
 *
 * The existing report builders answer fixed questions — this month, this year, net worth — which is
 * the right shape for a recurring snapshot and the wrong shape entirely for a question you thought of
 * five seconds ago. This module is the other half: one query object describing an arbitrary slice,
 * and one result object carrying both the matching rows and every total worth quoting about them.
 *
 * Everything here is pure. The UI, the CSV, the spreadsheet and the PDF all run through runReport()
 * and render the same ReportResult, so an exported file can never disagree with the screen it was
 * exported from — the same reason the monthly/yearly builders share their calculation modules.
 */

/**
 * Which of two different questions a report is answering (v1.2.7 remediation Phase 2):
 *
 * "economic" (the default) is the same meaning every other screen in the app uses — income/expense as
 * `classifyTransaction` reads them. A refund nets against the purchase it returned; a transfer, trade,
 * or debt-principal payment isn't spending or income at all. This is what "what did I spend on
 * restaurants" or "what's my income" should mean, and it's what makes a report agree with the
 * dashboard/budgets on the same figure.
 *
 * "cash-flow" is the literal, unfiltered question: how much money moved through this account,
 * regardless of what it meant. A refund is just another inbound euro, not netted against anything; a
 * trade's full buy/sell cash and a transfer's full amount count too — `includeTransfers` defaults to
 * true in this mode for exactly that reason, though an explicit `includeTransfers: false` still wins.
 * This is the right mode for "how much cash moved through this account this month", never for a
 * spending/income figure — see the report spec's FIN-002/FIN-005 residual findings for why conflating
 * the two was the bug.
