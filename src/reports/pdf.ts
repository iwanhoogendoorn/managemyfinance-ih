/**
 * PDF export, written straight to disk.
 *
 * This deliberately mirrors the mechanism the Food Spot and Are We There Yet plugins already use in
 * this vault, rather than inventing a third one. The approach that matters is the `<webview>` tag:
 * Electron gives it its own `printToPDF()`, so a document can be rendered and captured without
 * `@electron/remote`, without creating a BrowserWindow, and without the print dialog — which is the
 * difference between "opens a dialog you have to drive" and "there is a PDF on your disk now".
 *
 * The same renderer serves both callers. A person pressing Save as PDF gets a save dialog first; a
 * schedule firing at 9am on a Monday gets the bytes with no dialog at all, because there is nobody
 * there to answer one.
