 * The cost-basis buckets to use for *valuation* as of a date — as opposed to `investmentBucketsAsOf`,
 * which is pure historical-cost accounting and stays that way for `investingHoldings`/
 * `investingRealizedPnLAsOf` (a user's real, all-time cost basis and realized gain, for their own
 * record). This function exists only to feed `investingTotalValueAsOf`, and differs in one way: when a
 * snapshot exists, every currently-held ticker's cost basis is rescaled at the snapshot date so the
 * total reconciles with what the snapshot actually said the account was worth then.
 *
 * Why: a snapshot states real market value, which is exactly the number historical cost is *not* — a
 * position bought for €1,000 and worth €1,500 at snapshot time is still carried at €1,000 of historical
 * cost. Selling it after the snapshot for €1,500 books a €500 "realized gain" against that historical
 * cost — true, but already fully reflected in the snapshot's own €1,500. Adding it again double-counts
 * appreciation the snapshot had already captured (this was a real bug: see the regression tests below).
 * Rescaling at the snapshot date treats "you were worth what the snapshot said" as the new starting
 * point for valuation purposes — a mark-to-market reset — so a sale at exactly the snapshot-implied
 * price now nets to zero, and only genuinely *new* gain/loss since the snapshot shows up.
 *
 * The rescale is proportional across every ticker held at snapshot time, weighted by pre-reset cost
 * basis: `impliedSecuritiesValue = snapshot.balance − cash(asOf snapshot.date)` backs out the known cash
 * from the snapshot's total, and whatever's left is distributed across tickers in proportion to what
 * each was already carrying, on the assumption that a single whole-account balance can't say which
 * ticker specifically moved by how much. A ticker bought only *after* the snapshot is untouched by this
 * — it starts fresh at its own real cost, same as investmentBucketsAsOf.
 *
 * MVP simplification (documented limitations, not attempted here):
 * - With more than one snapshot on record, only the most recent one on or before `asOf` resets
 *   anything — an earlier snapshot's own reset isn't chained forward. Correct for the common case (one
 *   snapshot, or snapshots taken well apart); a position revalued at *two* snapshots in sequence would
 *   need chained resets to be exactly right.
 * - The single account-wide `resetFactor` is applied uniformly to every ticker held at snapshot time.
 *   If two tickers moved in *different* directions before the snapshot (one up, one down) but happened
 *   to net to roughly the same combined value, each ticker's individual post-reset basis can still be
 *   wrong even though the *account total* is exactly right — a whole-account balance genuinely can't
 *   say which position moved by how much. Fully correct per-ticker attribution would need
 *   position-level snapshot state (the audit's "preferred approach"), not attempted here.
 * - Degenerate case, handled rather than silently reproducing the bug: if every ticker held at snapshot
 *   time has ~€0 of historical cost basis (originalOpenCostBasis ≈ 0), the proportional-scaling ratio
 *   is undefined (dividing by ~0) — `impliedSecuritiesValue` is split evenly across those tickers
 *   instead. Exactly right for the common instance of this (a single near-zero-cost position); an even
 *   split is still an assumption, not a derivation, when multiple near-zero-cost tickers are held at
 *   once — but leaving `resetFactor` at a no-op `1` here (the reset never applying) would have quietly
 *   reintroduced the exact double-count this function exists to fix, for exactly the positions where
 *   the bug's effect is largest (a huge gain relative to a near-zero cost basis).

 * disagree with yet. Once a snapshot exists, though, historical cost and the snapshot's own market
 * value are two different numbers for the same position, and using historical-cost realized P/L there
 * double-counts whatever gain/loss the snapshot had already captured — see
 * `investmentBucketsForValuation`'s doc comment for the concrete failure case and the fix: a rescaled
 * ("mark-to-market") bucket set anchored at the snapshot, used only for this valuation window.
 *
 * A prior version of this fallback only applied the analytical add-back when no snapshot existed at
 * all, and once a snapshot was recorded, every trade *after* it went back to draining the account by
 * its full raw cash amount. A version after that fixed trades on positions opened *after* the snapshot,
 * but still double-counted a *pre-snapshot* position's already-captured appreciation when it was sold
 * post-snapshot. This version handles both.
