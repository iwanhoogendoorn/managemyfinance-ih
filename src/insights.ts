/**
 * §2.7 — the insights feed.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function over data the app already has; none of it needs a schema change,
 * a network call or a background job. The unifying idea is that the interesting facts in a ledger are
 * all *comparisons* — this charge against its own history, this month against the last three, what you
 * think you pay against what you're actually charged — and none of those comparisons is made anywhere
 * in the app today.
 *
 * Every insight carries an `impactEUR` so the feed can be ranked by money rather than by detector
 * order, and a deterministic `id` (a hash of kind + a stable natural key) so "dismiss" survives a
 * recompute, a re-import and a plugin reload. Ids deliberately fold in the *state* that made the
 * insight true — the charged amount, the month, the date last seen — so dismissing "Netflix went to
 * €12.99" doesn't also silence "Netflix went to €15.99" six months later.

 * The spread used as the outlier yardstick — MAD, with a fallback.

 * MAD goes to exactly 0 whenever more than half the samples are identical, which is common in a tight
 * category (ten €20 charges and two holidays) and is precisely the distribution where an outlier is
 * most obvious. A 0 scale would make the threshold `median` and flag every charge above it, so the
 * `deviation <= 0` guard silences the detector on its best case. Falling back to the mean absolute
 * deviation restores a sensible scale there while never being reached for a genuinely varied category.
 * Only a category where every single charge is identical scores 0 on both, and that one is skipped.
