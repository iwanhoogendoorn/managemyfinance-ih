 * Reviewing a statement one row at a time is the single most tedious thing this plugin asks of
 * anyone, and almost all of that tedium is repetition: the same supermarket forty times, the same
 * fuel station every fortnight. Categorization already fans out across a merchant automatically. The
 * *review decision* did not, so the queue still made you press approve forty times for a merchant you
 * had already made your mind up about.
 *
 * The two tiers from similarity.ts are kept visibly apart here, because they warrant different
 * levels of trust and the user needs to see which is which:
 *
 *   Same merchant  — merchantKey agrees. Pre-ticked. This is the grouping the whole app already runs on.
 *   Similar        — a string-similarity guess. Listed, collapsed, and ticked by nobody but the user.
 *
 * Nothing is written until a button is pressed, and the button always says how many rows it will
 * touch, so "apply to all of these" is never a leap of faith.
