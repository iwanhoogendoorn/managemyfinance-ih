 *
 * Every level resolves to a plain from/to pair rather than being carried through the filter as a mode
 * of its own: the ledger already compares ISO date strings, so "August" is just two dates it would
 * otherwise have had you type. It also means switching to "Custom range…" leaves you holding the
 * range you were already looking at, instead of clearing back to nothing.
