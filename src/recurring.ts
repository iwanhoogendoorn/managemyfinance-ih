 * The app's second universe (hand-entered `Subscription` records) never touches the first (imported
 * transactions), so a price rise, a phantom charge or a cancelled-but-still-billing service is
 * invisible today. Everything needed to see them is already in the ledger: a counterparty, an amount
 * and a date. This module turns those three fields into series — "this merchant charges you roughly
 * this much, roughly this often" — and four separate features (subscription detection, price drift,
 * phantom/zombie subscriptions, next-paycheck prediction) all read from it rather than each
 * re-deriving their own grouping.
 *
 * Pure: no Obsidian imports, no `Date.now()` except where a caller explicitly declines to pass a
 * reference date. Every date is an ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` string and all arithmetic runs in UTC, so a
 * series spanning a DST boundary doesn't gain or lose a day and drift out of its cycle band.
