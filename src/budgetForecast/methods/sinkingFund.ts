/**
 * The sinking-fund method (budget_spec.md §33–34) — car repairs, medical, dentist, electronics,
 * legal, home improvement, large travel: sparse, irregular expenses where a monthly median of raw
 * months is nearly always €0 and tells you nothing. Aggregated by *calendar year* instead, where a
 * year has enough tracked coverage to trust its total, then converted back down to a monthly (or
 * pay-cycle) reserve.
 *
 * A large irregular year is never auto-excluded the way a seasonal outlier is (§23–24) — a €2,800
 * repair is exactly the risk this reserve exists to absorb, so it stays included by default and is
 * surfaced as a *notable* event instead. The user can still exclude one, but the framing is "was this
 * genuinely non-repeatable" (a first car purchase), not "was this unusually large."
